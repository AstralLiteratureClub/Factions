  # If this is set to false, non-administrator players cannot load offline players to the server.
  # For example, when a player executes command "/factions info -player <offline-player>"
  #  it might lag the server for a bit, because the server needs to load the offline player's data
  #   and load the faction data for the offline player.
  # The player data in faction should be that large.
  #  So it would make massive lag to the server, but it's still a possibility if the command is spammed.
